                Tom and Jerry is an American animated media franchise and series of comedy short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph 
                Barbera. Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series centers on the rivalry between the 
                titular characters of a cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry. Many shorts also feature several recurring characters. In its 
                original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 Tom and Jerry shorts for MGM from 1940 to 1958.[1] During this time, they won seven 
                Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film, tying for first place with Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies with the most awards in the 
                category. After the MGM cartoon studio closed in 1957, MGM revived the series with Gene Deitch directing an additional 13 Tom and 
                Jerry shorts for Rembrandt Films from 1961 to 1962.
